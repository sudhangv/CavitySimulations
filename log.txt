id - 19  --- After nice result from 0.295 by setting source component = mp.Ey, changing it to 0.303

Added poly_tapering, changed f = 1/1536 --> 1/1.54

changed a_taperred --> a_poly_tapered

id - 21

Ran OG polynomial tapering witg a_cen = 0.349, a_end = 0.4, hx = hy = 0.25

id - 23  POLY

Changed wavg h to 0.22 and wvg w to 0.7,  hx = 0.25, hy = 0.4, w = 0.7, a_cen = 0.354, a_mirror = 0.4

id 27  POLY

same as id 23, just changed n_segments = 20

id 28

hx = 0.3, hy = 0.5, a = 0.449, w = 0.7, gamma = 0.1697

id 31  POLY

Same as ID 28, resolution : 30 ---> 40

id 32

Same as id 31, n_taper ---> 5, n_segment -----> 10
